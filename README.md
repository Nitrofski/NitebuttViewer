# NitebuttViewer

This tool is a highly styleable Current Song viewer for Nightbot beta. I had to develop this because of the limitations brought by the current Nightbot app, as well as the OBS-studio text tool, which made creating some good looking stuff quite impossible.

With a minimal knowledge of CSS, you can get the fields in this tool to look however you like 'em. You can also hide unwanted fields and things like that. I have yet to decide how I want to develop on the costumization aspect, so if you have ideas or suggestion, feel free to message me about them.

## How to use

Use the following URL as a Browser Source on OBS or whatever it's called on other streaming software: `https://nitrofski.github.io/NitebuttViewer`.
Due to the need to get authorized to use the Nightbot API outside of their domain, you will need to accept the prompt by interacting with the source. This should at most be needed once a month. Once set, costumize the `#song_request` and `#req_url` elements to your heart's content, and Voil√†!, you have a way to display the currently playing sound that doesn't suck. :)
